# FirefoxUI hybrid
Missing old firefox?
This theme is a combination between australis UI and photon UI, hopefully you'll like it :D

# IMPORTANT!!!
- Copy the userStyle.css file to your firefox profile chrome folder [Tutorial](http://kb.mozillazine.org/index.php?title=UserChrome.css&printable=yes)


- Please make sure to customize the order of your buttons as it shows in the image below, before you install skin:

- Due to the experimental nature of Nightly Mozilla tends to break the theme, if you use Nightly uncomment the section: 
  /* NIGHTLY FIX */

  *Please note that this does NOT apply to Firefox Stable, Beta and Developer channels, it ONLY applies to Nightly channel.*
  
- If you experience any issues or you have a preference which is not included in the skin, open an [Issue](https://github.com/axydavid/FirefoxUI/issues/new), and I'll have a look at it, you can also cantact me via [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/axy_david/).
